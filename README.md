# Microblog

A fullstack blogging app where users can create/delete/edit their own posts, like/unlike posts, and add/edit/delete comments. The frontend was built with React and Redux, while the backend (provided by Rithm School, but tweaked by me) was built with Express and PostgreSQL.

## How did we build this?:

* React
* React Router
* React Redux
* React Thunk

## What can you do?:

* Create/Delete/Edit Posts
* Like/Unlike posts
* Add/Edit/Delete Comments
